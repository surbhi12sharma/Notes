            <h1>Introduction to Graphs</h1>

            <h2>Components of a Graph:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vertices (Nodes)</strong>: The fundamental units of the graph, representing entities.</li>
                <li><strong>Edges</strong>: The connections between pairs of vertices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Graphs:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Directed Graph (Digraph)</strong>: Each edge has a direction, going from one vertex to
                    another.</li>
                <li><strong>Undirected Graph</strong>: Edges do not have a direction and simply connect two vertices.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Weighted Graph</strong>: Edges have weights representing the cost, length, or capacity of
                    the connection.</li>
                <li><strong>Unweighted Graph</strong>: All edges are considered to have the same weight.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Representations of Graphs:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adjacency List</strong>: Each vertex stores a list of adjacent vertices.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjacency Matrix</strong>: A 2D array where a cell (i, j) indicates the presence (and
                    possibly the weight) of an edge between vertices i and j.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Graph Algorithms:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Traversal Algorithms:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Depth-First Search (DFS)</strong>: Explores as far as possible along each branch
                            before backtracking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong>: Explores all neighbors at the present depth
                            before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Shortest Path Algorithms:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm</strong>: Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all
                            other vertices in a weighted graph.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bellman-Ford Algorithm</strong>: Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all
                            other vertices, handling negative weights.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Kruskal's Algorithm</strong>: Constructs the MST by adding edges in ascending weight
                            order, ensuring no cycles.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prim's Algorithm</strong>: Builds the MST by starting from an arbitrary vertex and
                            adding the cheapest edge to the tree.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Applications of Graphs:</h2>

            <h4>Bipartite Graph(BFS)/ DFS</h4>
            1. In place of visited take color in BFS</br>
            2. check if neg color is same as curr node. If same return false </br>
            3. Place the neg node in queue</br>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Detect Cycle in an Undirected Graph (using BFS)</h4>
            1. For BFS traversal, we need a queue data structure and a visited array. <br>
            2. Push the pair of the source node and its parent data (<source, parent>) in the queue, and mark the node
                as visited. The parent will be needed so that we donâ€™t do a backward traversal in the graph, we just
                move frontwards. <br>
                3. Start the BFS traversal, pop out an element from the queue every time and travel to all its unvisited
                neighbors using an adjacency list.<br>
                4. Repeat the steps either until the queue becomes empty, or a node appears to be already visited which
                is not the parent, even though we traveled in different directions during the traversal, indicating
                there is a cycle.<br>
                5. If the queue becomes empty and no such node is found then there is no cycle in the graph.<br>
                else if(adjacentNode != parent) return true;
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>DFS</h4>
            else if(adjacentNode != parent) return true;
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Detect cycle in a directed graph (using DFS)</h4>
            1. We will traverse the graph component-wise using the DFS technique. <br>
            2. Make sure to carry two visited arrays in the DFS call. One is a visited array(vis) and the other is a
            path-visited(pathVis) array. The visited array keeps a track of visited nodes, and the path-visited keeps a
            track of visited nodes in the current traversal only. <br>
            3. While making a DFS call, at first we will mark the node as visited in both the arrays and then will
            traverse through its adjacent nodes. Now, there may be either of the three cases:<br>
            4. Case 1: If the adjacent node is not visited, we will make a new DFS call recursively with that particular
            node.<br>
            5. Case 2: If the adjacent node is visited and also on the same path(i.e marked visited in the pathVis
            array), we will return true, because it means it has a cycle, thereby the pathVis was true. Returning true
            will mean the end of the function call, as once we have got a cycle, there is no need to check for further
            adjacent nodes. <br>
            6. Case 3: If the adjacent node is visited but not on the same path(i.e not marked in the pathVis array), we
            will continue to the next adjacent node, as it would have been marked as visited in some other path, and not
            on the current one.<br>
            7. Finally, if there are no further nodes to visit, we will unmark the current node in the pathVis array and
            just return false. Then we will backtrack to the previous node with the returned value. The point to
            remember is, while we enter we mark both the pathVis and vis as true, but at the end of traversal to all
            adjacent nodes, we just make sure we unmark the pathVis and still keep the vis marked as true, as it will
            avoid future extra traversal calls. <br>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>TopoSort (DFS)</h4>
            1. We must traverse all components of the graph.<br>
            2. Make sure to carry a visited array(all elements are initialized to 0) and a stack data structure, where
            we are going to store the nodes after completing the DFS call.<br>
            3. In the DFS call, first, the current node is marked as visited. Then DFS call is made for all its adjacent
            nodes.<br>
            4. After visiting all its adjacent nodes, DFS will backtrack to the previous node and meanwhile, the current
            node is pushed into the stack.<br>
            5. Finally, we will get the stack containing one of the topological sortings of the graph.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Kahn's Algorithm | Topological Sort Algorithm | BFS </h4>
            1. First, we will calculate the indegree of each node and store it in the indegree array. We can iterate
            through the given adj list, and simply for every node u->v, we can increase the indegree of v by 1 in the
            indegree array. <br>
            2. Initially, there will be always at least a single node whose indegree is 0. So, we will push the node(s)
            with indegree 0 into the queue.<br>
            3. Then, we will pop a node from the queue including the node in our answer array, and for all its adjacent
            nodes, we will decrease the indegree of that node by one. For example, if node u that has been popped out
            from the queue has an edge towards node v(u->v), we will decrease indegree[v] by 1.<br>
            4. After that, if for any node the indegree becomes 0, we will push that node again into the queue.<br>
            5. We will repeat steps 3 and 4 until the queue is completely empty. Finally, completing the BFS we will get
            the linear ordering of the nodes in the answer array.<br>

            <h4>Shortest Path in Directed Acyclic Graph Topological Sort</h4>
            1. In bfs code check with distance instead of visited<br>
            let dist = distance[node] + wt<br>
            if (dist < distance[neg]) <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Shortest Path in Undirected Graph with unit distance</h4>

            same as Shortest Path in Directed Acyclic Graph Topological Sort

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Implementing Dijkstra Algorithm</h4>
            Use bfs using priority queue and take min distance at the top of priority queue;
        </li>

            Use for detect negative cycle<br>
            1. Take distance array of length N and Infinity in every element<br>

                &ensp; &ensp; if (dist[u] !== Infinity && dist[v] > dist[u] + wt) {<br>
                &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; dist[v] = dist[u] + wt<br>
                &ensp; &ensp;}<br>
                &ensp; }<br>

            <h4>Spanning Tree</h4>
            A tree which we have N nodes and N-1 edges & all nodes are rechargeable from each other.
            <h4>minimum Spanning Tree</h4>
            Among all possible spanning trees of a graph, the minimum spanning tree is the one for which the sum of all
            the edge weights is the minimum.<br>
            1. Take the priority queue with weight and node<br>
            2. Take visited array N size with 0 in all the idx<br>
            3. execute bfs algo using priority queue<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Prim's Algo</h4>
            prims algo help us to find min spaining tree weight<br>
            1. We will first push edge weight 0, node value 0, and parent -1 as a triplet into the priority queue to
            start the algorithm.<br>
            Note: We can start from any node of our choice. Here we have chosen node 0.<br>
            2. Then the top-most element (element with minimum edge weight as it is the min-heap we are using) of the
            priority queue is popped out.<br>
            3. After that, we will check whether the popped-out node is visited or not.<br>
            If the node is visited: We will continue to the next element of the priority queue.<br>
            If the node is not visited: We will mark the node visited in the visited array and add the edge weight to
            the sum variable. If we wish to store the mst, we should insert the parent node and the current node into
            the mst array as a pair in this step.<br>
            4. Now, we will iterate on all the unvisited adjacent nodes of the current node and will store each of their
            information in the specified triplet format i.e. (edge weight, node value, and parent node) in the priority
            queue.<br>
            5. We will repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 using a loop until the priority queue becomes empty.<br>
            6. Finally, the sum variable should store the sum of all the edge weights of the minimum spanning tree.

            <h4>Disjoint Set</h4>
            Read from <a
                href="https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/disjoint-set-union-by-rank-union-by-size-path-compression-g-46/">Link</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Kruskalâ€™s Algo:-</h4>
            1. First, we need to extract the edge information(if not given already) from the given adjacency list in the
            format of (wt, u, v) where u is the current node, v is the adjacent node and wt is the weight of the edge
            between node u and v and we will store the tuples in an array.<br>
            2. Then the array must be sorted in the ascending order of the weights so that while iterating we can get
            the edges with the minimum weights first.<br>
            3. After that, we will iterate over the edge information, and for each tuple, we will apply the following
            operation:<br>
            3a. First, we will take the two nodes u and v from the tuple and check if the ultimate parents of both nodes
            are the same or not using the findUPar() function provided by the Disjoint Set data structure.<br>
            3b. If the ultimate parents are the same, we need not do anything to that edge as there already exists a
            path between the nodes and we will continue to the next tuple.<br>
            3c. If the ultimate parents are different, we will add the weight of the edge to our final answer(i.e. mstWt
            variable used in the following code) and apply the union operation(i.e. either unionBySize(u, v) or
            unionByRank(u, v)) with the nodes u and v. The union operation is also provided by the Disjoint Set.<br>
            4. Finally, we will get our answer (in the mstWt variable as used in the following code) successfully.<br>
