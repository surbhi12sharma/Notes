Type of graph
1. Directed  and undirected


TOPOSORT:-(DFS) ->direct asycic graph
Linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge between u&v, u appears before v in that ordering.


Dijkstra -> help in detect cycle
Bellman Ford Algo-> Help in detect negative cycle. Only applicable in DG(directed graph)

Floyd warshal Algo -> Helps in detect multisource shortest path. and negative cycle

Minimum spanning Tree:-> A tree in which we have n nodes and n-1 edges and all notes are reachable from each other

kruskal Algo:-> used to find Minimum spanning Tree

Articulation Point:-> Nodes on whose removal the graph breaks into multiple components

Kosaraju's Algo->
1. Sort all the edges according to finishing time
2. Reverse the graph
3. Do a dfs
