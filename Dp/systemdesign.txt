Vertical Scaling -> Optimize Process and increse throughput with the same resources

Preprocessing and core jobs -> Preparing before hand during non-peak hours

Resilience -> Recovering from failures quickly (keep backups and avoid single point of failures)

Hoizontal Scaling -> Hire more resources (buying more machine of similar type to get more work done)
